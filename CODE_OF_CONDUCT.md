# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders of *Playtestr*, pledge to make participation in our project and community a welcoming, safe, and harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment for our community include:

- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
- Providing constructive feedback and accepting it gracefully.
- Focusing on what is best for the community and the project.
- Showing empathy and kindness toward others.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others’ private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, and to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including GitHub repositories, Discord channels, forums, and any other locations where the community interacts, as well as when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers at [playtestr@lunchbreak.games](mailto:playtestr@lunchbreak.games). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Consequences

Community members who do not follow this Code of Conduct may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by the project’s maintainers.
